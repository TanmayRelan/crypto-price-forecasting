# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices against the Indian Rupee (INR) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to retain information over long sequences.

**Libraries Used:**
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas:** For data handling and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization and plotting.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For data splitting and performance evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the LSTM model.

**Key Functions and Components:**

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - **`load_data(file_path)`**: Loads historical Bitcoin price data from a CSV file.
  - **`preprocess_data(df)`**: Cleans and normalizes the data to prepare it for model training.
  - **`create_dataset(data, time_step)`**: Converts the data into sequences for training the LSTM model.

- **Model Building:**
  - **`build_lstm_model(input_shape)`**: Constructs the LSTM model with specified input shape and layers.
  - **`compile_model(model)`**: Compiles the LSTM model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

- **Training and Evaluation:**
  - **`train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs, batch_size)`**: Trains the LSTM model on the training data.
  - **`evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)`**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

- **Visualization:**
  - **`plot_predictions(y_true, y_pred)`**: Plots the predicted prices against actual prices for visual assessment.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully predicted Bitcoin prices with a well-performing LSTM model.
- Achieved a robust evaluation score, demonstrating the modelâ€™s reliability in forecasting.

This project showcases proficiency in time series forecasting using LSTM networks and highlights skills in data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.
